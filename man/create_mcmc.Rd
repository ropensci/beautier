\title{Create an MCMC configuration.}
\usage{
create_mcmc(
  chain_length = 1e+07,
  store_every = -1,
  pre_burnin = 0,
  n_init_attempts = 10,
  sample_from_prior = FALSE,
  tracelog = create_tracelog(),
  screenlog = create_screenlog(),
  treelog = create_treelog()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{chain_length}{length of the MCMC chain}

\item{store_every}{number of states the MCMC will process
before the posterior's state will be saved to file.
Use -1 or \code{NA} to use the default frequency.}

\item{pre_burnin}{number of burn in samples taken before entering
the main loop}

\item{n_init_attempts}{number of initialization attempts before failing}

\item{sample_from_prior}{set to \link{TRUE} to sample from the prior}

\item{tracelog}{a \code{tracelog},
as created by \link{create_tracelog}}

\item{screenlog}{a \code{screenlog},
as created by \link{create_screenlog}}

\item{treelog}{a \code{treelog},
as created by \link{create_treelog}}
}
\value{
an MCMC configuration
}
\description{
Create an MCMC configuration, as in the BEAUti MCMC tab.
}
\details{
There are four things that can be saved:
 * \code{store_every}: saves the state of the MCMC to file,
   as a \code{.state.xml} file
 * \code{tracelog}: stores the trace of the state of the MCMC
   to file. See \code{create_tracelog}
   how to specify the filename
 * \code{screenlog}: stores the screen output
   to file. See \code{create_screenlog}
   how to specify the filename
 * \code{treelog}: stores the estimated phylogenies
   to file. See \code{create_treelog}
   how to specify the filename
}

if (is_on_ci()) {

  # Create an MCMC chain with 50 states

Use \code{\link{create_test_mcmc}} to create a short regular MCMC,
that can be used for testing runs.
Use \code{\link{create_ns_mcmc}} to create an MCMC for a Nested Sampling run.
Use \code{\link{check_mcmc}} to check if an MCMC is valid.
Use \code{\link{rename_mcmc_filenames}} to rename the filenames in an MCMC.
