\usage{
create_mrca_prior(
  alignment_id = NA,
  taxa_names = NA,
  is_monophyletic = FALSE,
  mrca_distr = NA,
  name = NA,
  clock_prior_distr_id = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{alignment_id}{ID of the alignment,
as returned by \link{get_alignment_id}.
Keep at \code{NA} to have it initialized automatically}

\item{taxa_names}{names of the taxa,
as returned by \code{\link{get_taxa_names}}.
Keep at \code{NA} to have it initialized automatically,
using all taxa in the alignment}

\item{is_monophyletic}{boolean to indicate monophyly is assumed in
a Most Recent Common Ancestor prior,
as returned by \code{\link{create_mrca_prior}}}

\item{mrca_distr}{the distribution used by the MRCA prior.
Can be NA (the default) or any distribution
returned by \code{\link{create_distr}}}

\item{name}{the unique name of the MRCA prior, for example a genus, family,
order or even class name.
Leave at \link{NA} to have it named automatically.}

\item{clock_prior_distr_id}{ID of an MRCA clock model's distribution.
Keep at \code{NA} to have it initialized automatically}
}
\value{
an MRCA prior
}
