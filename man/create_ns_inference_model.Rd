\arguments{
\item{site_model}{a site model,

Use \code{\link{create_mcmc}} to create an MCMC.
Use \code{\link{create_ns_mcmc}} to create an MCMC
  for a Nested Sampling run.
Use \code{\link{check_mcmc}} to check if an MCMC is valid.
Use \code{\link{rename_mcmc_filenames}} to rename the filenames in an MCMC.}

an inference model

\description{
Create an inference model to measure the evidence of.
To do so, the inference model is created as usual (see
\link{create_inference_model}), except
for using a Nested Sampling MCMC (see \link{create_ns_mcmc})
}
\examples{
check_empty_beautier_folder()

inference_model <- create_ns_inference_model()

check_empty_beautier_folder()
}
\seealso{
Use \link{create_inference_model} to create a
regular  inference model.
Use \link{create_test_ns_inference_model} to create an inference model
to estimate the marginal likelihood with a short MCMC,
to be used in testing.
